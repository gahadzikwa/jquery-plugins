_Created with whole lotta love by [@serbanghita](http://twitter.com/serbanghita)_

This repository contains useful jQuery and jQuery mobile plugins. If you find any of these useful let me know by staring or forking the project.

##### Current jQuery plugins:

[jQuery Chessboard](https://github.com/serbanghita/jQuery-Chess) - Is an attempt to reproduce [Chess.com](http://www.chess.com) chess board with the help of jQuery and jQuery UI. The chessboard is also designed with mobile in mind.

*jQuery kiNotice* - Is an attempt to reproduce KissInsights's (now [qualaroo](http://qualaroo.com/)) survey popup.

*jQuery VerySimpleSlideshow* - Is an extremely light-weight slideshow script with respect of the following properties: respect the jQuery plugin standards, keep compressed plugin as small as possible (<1.2kb),
do not use any CSS but support them, depend only on jQuery (not UI), compatible with jQuery v.1.2 and above, make sure it works for every browser (works in IE6).

##### Current jQuery Mobile plugins:

[jQuery Mobile dynamic popup](https://github.com/serbanghita/jQM-dynamic-popup) - It gives the developer the possibility to run the popup() function from jQuery Mobile 1.2 without caring about HTML code, code placement, etc. and focusing only on the content & behaviour of the popup.
